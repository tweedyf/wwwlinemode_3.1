        Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.

   This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our tar files.
   The package contains source code for building World-Wide Web applications
   and related reference applications. In its full contents it contains the
   source code for the following modules:
   
      W3C Reference Library
      
      CERN HTTPD
      
      Line Mode Browser
      
      Next Browser/Editor
      
   At the bottom of this file, you will find pointers to more information.
   
Handling the Distribution Files

   All distribution files contain the source code for each of the modules. W3C
   also provides a wide set of precompiled binaries which are available either
   directly via HTTP or via anonymous FTP from ftp.w3.org.
   
   All of the distribution packets are available as compressed tar files, and
   some are also available as zip files. For the compressed tar files, first
   uncompress and untar the file <dist>.tar.Z where <dist> is the name of the
   specific distribution:
   
        uncompress <dist>.tar.Z

   Then untar the file by typing
   
        tar xf <dist>.tar

   For the zip files, type the following:
   
        unzip <dist>.zip

Generated Directory structure

   The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this) directory.
   They create different parts of a common directory tree under that directory.
   There may be some duplication. They also generate a few files in this
   directory: README, COPYRIGH, and some installation instructions. The
   structure of the untar'ed package is as follows (directories):
   
        WWW                             Top-node

        WWW/All/*/Makefile.include      Platform dependent make files

        WWW/Library                     W3C Reference Library
        WWW/Library/Implementation      Source Code
        WWW/Library/<platform>/*        Platform dependent object files

        WWW/Daemon                      CERN HTTPD
        WWW/Daemon/Implementation       Source Code
        WWW/Daemon/<platform>/*         Platform dependent object files

        WWW/LineMode                    LineMode Browser
        WWW/LineMode/Implementation     Source Code
        WWW/LineMode/<platform>/*       Platform dependent object files

        WWW/Next                        Next Browser/Editor
        WWW/Next/Implementation         Source Code
        WWW/Next/<platform>/*           Platform dependent object files

   Some or more of these directories might not be there. This depends on the
   number of distribution files. In general there is one distribution file pr.
   module (Library, LineMode Browser, and Daemon). The Library distribution
   file is required for all the other module.
   
Compilation

   Compilation can be put into two groups depending on if the platform is
   supported in the BUILD script or not. The BUILD script is placed in the WWW
   directory and you can use it to compile and link the W3C applications. The
   BUILD script figures out what platform you are on and generates a Makefile
   which consists of a platform independent part and a platform dependent part.
   
  COMPILATION ON ALREADY SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
  
   To BUILD any of the applications go to the WWW directory and type
   
        ./BUILD library

        ./BUILD daemon

        ./BUILD linemode

   or simply
   
        ./BUILD

   in order to BUILD all applications
   
  COMPILATION ON NON-SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
  
   This will require some more work, but please read the online documentation
   [1].
   
   For Windows NT we have a special README-WinNT file provided by Charlie
   Brooks.
   
W3C Reference Library

   The W3C Reference Library is a general code base that can be used to build
   clients and servers. It contains code for accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News,
   WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file system. Furthermore it provides
   modules for parsing, managing and presenting hypertext objects to the user
   and a wide spectra of generic programming utilities. The Library is the
   basis for many World-Wide Web applications and all the W3C software is build
   on top of it. The Library is a required part of all other W3C applications
   in this distribution.
   
   You can get more information from the online documentation [2] and if you
   don't have a WWW client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no userid or password
   required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.
   
LineMode Browser

   The Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web Browser.  It is
   developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool for the Common Code
   Library. It can be run in interactive mode, non- interactive mode and as a
   proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety of possibilities for data
   format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool
   for quick access to the Web or used in batch jobs.
   
   Installation is very simple as the application can run without any
   particular seup. You can specify your own HOME PAGE using the WWW_HOME
   environment variable. Remember toy setup a NNTPSERVER environment variable
   before you try to access a news server.
   
   You can get more information from the is available at online documentation
   [3] and if you don't have a WWW client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no
   userid or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.
   
Server

   CERN httpd is a generic public domain full-featured hypertext server which
   can be used as a regular HTTP server. The running typically on port 80 to
   serve hypertext and other documents, and also as a proxy -- a server on a
   firewall machine -- that provides access for people inside a firewall to the
   outside world. When running as proxy httpd may be configured to do caching
   of documents resulting in faster response times.
   
   Follow instructions above for compiling and then go on to "Installing the
   basic W3 server".
   
   You can get more information from the is available at online documentation
   [4] and if you don't have a WWW client then telnet to telnet.w3.org (no
   userid or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.
   
NeXTStep Browser/Editor

   The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application
   directory WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is compiled. When you
   install the app, you may want to configure the default page,
   WorldWideWeb.app/default.html. These must point to some useful information!
   You should keep it up to date with pointers to info on your site and
   elsewhere. If you use the W3C home page note there is a link at the bottom
   to the master copy on our server. You should set up the address of your
   local news server with
   
        dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost news

   replacing the last word with the actual address of your news host. See
   Installation instructions.
   
   You can get more information from the is available at is available at online
   documentation [5] and if you don't have a WWW client then telnet to
   telnet.w3.org (no userid or password required) and you will get the Line
   Mode Browser.
