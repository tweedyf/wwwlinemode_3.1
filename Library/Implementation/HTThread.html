This module contains the routines for handling the set of active
sockets currently in use by the multithreaded clients. It is an
internal module to the Library, the application interface is
implemented in the <A HREF="HTEvntrg.html">Event Module</A>. Look for
more information in the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Architecture/Threads.html">
Multithread Specifications</A>. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTThread.c">HTThread.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A NAME="z10"
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/">
W3C Reference Library</A>.

<A NAME="Init"><H2>Initiation</H2></A>

This function initiates the arrays of socket descriptors used in the
Library. It's called in <A HREF="HTAccess.html#Library">HTLibInit()</A>.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadInit	NOPARAMS;
</PRE>

<IMG ALT="NOTE"
SRC="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Icons/32x32/caution.gif"> It is
<B>VERY</B> important that this one is called before the first
request, as otherwise the socket bit arrays are uninitialized.

<H2>Registration of a Thread</H2>

These two functions put a <A HREF="HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo
object</A> into the list of threads and takes it out again
respectively. A normal place to call these functions would be on
creation and deletion of the <CODE>HTNetInfo</CODE> data structure.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThread_new	PARAMS((HTNetInfo * new_net));
extern BOOL HTThread_clear	PARAMS((HTNetInfo * old_net));
</PRE>

<H2>Kill a Thread</H2>

This function forces a call to the load function and resets the state
machine. It also removes the thread from the list of active threads.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThread_kill	PARAMS((HTNetInfo * net));
</PRE>

<H2>Is Thread Alive?</H2>

Checks whether a thread is still registered and if so returns the
corresponding <A HREF="HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest structure</A>, else
return NULL.

<PRE>
extern HTRequest *HTThread_isAlive	PARAMS((HTNetInfo * net));
</PRE>

<H2>Get Copy of Registered Bit-arrays</H2>

This function returns a copy of the current bit-arrays contaning the
active sockets registered for <CODE>READ</CODE> and
<CODE>WRITE</CODE>.

<PRE>
extern int HTThreadGetFDInfo 	PARAMS((fd_set * read, fd_set * write));
</PRE>

<H2>Registration of the State of a Socket</H2>

When a new request is initiated from the client and a socket has been
created, is gets registered in a linked list of <A
HREF="HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo objects</A>. The object stays
in this list until the request has ended (either having an error or
success as result). Every time the program execution gets to a point
where a socket operation would normally block the program, this
function is called in order to register the socket as waiting for the
actual operation.

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTThreadAction {
    THD_SET_WRITE=0,
    THD_CLR_WRITE,
    THD_SET_READ,
    THD_CLR_READ,
    THD_SET_INTR,
    THD_CLR_INTR,
    THD_CLOSE,
    THD_SET_CONNECT,
    THD_CLR_CONNECT
} HTThreadAction;
</PRE>

<PRE>
extern void HTThreadState		PARAMS((SOCKFD sockfd,
					HTThreadAction action));
extern void HTThreadStateByRequest	PARAMS((HTRequest * request,
					HTThreadAction action));
</PRE>

This function makes life easier if you want to mark all sockets as
interrupted.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadMarkIntrAll	PARAMS((CONST fd_set * fd_user));
</PRE>

<H2>Is a Thread Interrupted?</H2>

This function returns YES if the socket is registered as interrupted

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadIntr	PARAMS((SOCKFD sockfd));
</PRE>

<H2>Any Threads Registered?</H2>

This function returns YES if any HTTP sockets are still registered in the
set of active sockets. Otherwise it returns NO.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTThreadActive	NOPARAMS;
</PRE>

<H2>Select an Active Thread</H2>

When the <CODE>select</CODE> function has returned a set of pending
sockets this functions selects one of them and finds the
correseponding request structure.

<PRE>
extern HTRequest *HTThread_getRequest	PARAMS((CONST fd_set * fd_read,
						CONST fd_set * fd_write));

#endif
