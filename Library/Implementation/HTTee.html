The Tee stream just writes everything you put into it into two oter
streams. One use (the only use?!) is for taking a cached copey on disk
while loading the main copy, without having to wait for the disk copy
to be finished and reread it. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTTee.c">HTTee.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A
