<A NAME="parse"><H2>Parsing URIs</H2></A>

These functions can be used to get information in a URI.

<H3>Parse a URI relative to another URI</H3>

This returns those parts of a name which are given (and requested)
substituting bits from the related name where necessary. The
<CODE>aName</CODE> argument is the (possibly relative) URI to be
parsed, the <CODE>relatedName</CODE> is the URI which the
<CODE>aName</CODE> is to be parsed relative to. Passing an empty
string means that the <CODE>aName</CODE> is an absolute URI. The
following are flag bits which may be OR'ed together to form a number
to give the 'wanted' argument to HTParse.

<PRE>
#define PARSE_ACCESS		16
#define PARSE_HOST		 8
#define PARSE_PATH		 4
#define PARSE_ANCHOR		 2
#define PARSE_PUNCTUATION	 1
#define PARSE_ALL		31
</PRE>

where the format of a URI is as follows:

<PRE>
/*
	ACCESS :// HOST / PATH # ANCHOR
*/
</PRE>

<CODE>PUNCTUATION</CODE> means any delimiter like '/', ':', '#'
between the tokens above.

The string returned by the function must be freed by the caller.

<PRE>
extern char * HTParse  PARAMS((	const char * aName,
				const char * relatedName,
				int wanted));
</PRE>

<H3>Create a Relative (Partial) URI</H3>

This function creates and returns a string which gives an expression
of one address as related to another.  Where there is no relation, an
absolute address is retured.

<H3>On entry,</H3>Both names must be absolute, fully
qualified names of nodes (no anchor
bits)
<H3>On exit,</H3>The return result points to a newly
allocated name which, if parsed by
HTParse relative to relatedName,
will yield aName. The caller is responsible
for freeing the resulting name later.

<PRE>
extern char * HTRelative PARAMS((const char * aName, const char *relatedName));
</PRE>

<A NAME="canon"><H2>Canonicalization</H2></A>

Canonicalization of URIs is a difficult job, but it saves a lot of
down loads and double entries in the cache if we do a good job...

<H3>Canonicalize the Path Part of a URI</H3>

A URI is allowed to contain the seqeunce xxx/../ which may be
replaced by "" , and the seqeunce "/./" which may be replaced by "/".
Simplification helps us recognize duplicate URIs. Thus, the following
transformations are done:

<UL>
<LI> /etc/junk/../fred 	becomes	/etc/fred
<LI> /etc/junk/./fred	becomes	/etc/junk/fred
</UL>

but we should NOT change
<UL>
<LI> http://fred.xxx.edu/../.. or
<LI> ../../albert.html
</UL>

In the same manner, the following prefixed are preserved:

<UL>
<LI> ./<etc>
<LI> //<etc>
</UL>

In order to avoid empty URIs the following URIs become:

<UL>
<LI> /fred/..		becomes /fred/..
<LI> /fred/././..		becomes /fred/..
<LI> /fred/.././junk/.././	becomes /fred/..
</UL>

If more than one set of `://' is found (several proxies in cascade) then
only the part after the last `://' is simplified.

<PRE>
extern char *HTSimplify PARAMS((char **filename));
</PRE>

<H3>Canonicalize the DNS part of a URI</H3>

This function expands the host name of the URI from a local name to a
full domain name and converts the host name to lower case. The
advantage by doing this is that we only have one entry in the host
case and one entry in the document cache.

<PRE>
extern char *HTCanon PARAMS ((	char **	filename,
				char *	host));
</PRE>

<A NAME="secure"><H2>Prevent Security Holes</H2></A>

In many telnet like protocols, it can be very dangerous to allow a
full ASCII character set to be in a URI. Therefore we have to strip
them out.

<CODE>HTCleanTelnetString()</CODE> makes sure that the given string
doesn't contain characters that could cause security holes, such as
newlines in ftp, gopher, news or telnet URLs; more specifically:
allows everything between hexadesimal ASCII 20-7E, and also A0-FE,
inclusive.
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>str</CODE>
<DD> the string that is *modified* if necessary.  The string will be
     truncated at the first illegal character that is encountered.
<DT>returns
<DD> YES, if the string was modified.
     NO, otherwise.
</DL>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTCleanTelnetString PARAMS((char * str));
