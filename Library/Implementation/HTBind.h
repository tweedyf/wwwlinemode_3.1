   This module sets up the binding between a file Bind and a media type, language,
   encoding etc. In a client application the Binds are used in protocols that does not
   support media types etc., like FTP, and in server applications they are used to make
   the bindings between the server and the local file store that the server can serve to
   the rest of the world (well almost). The HTFormat module holds this information against
   the accept headers received in a request and uses if for format negotiation. All the
   binding management can all be replace by a database interface.
   
   This module is implemented by HTBind.c, and it is a part of the W3C Reference Library.

   The first method is a "super" method for binding information to a file suffic. Any of
   the string values can be NULL. If filename suffix is already defined its previous
   definition is overridden or modified. For example, a HTBind_setType and
   HTBind_setEncoding can be called with the same suffix.
   
   Calling this with suffix set to "*" will set the default representation. Calling this
   with suffix set to "*.*" will set the default representation for unknown suffix files
   which contain a "."
   
   NOTE: The suffixes can contain characters that must be escaped in a URL. However, they
   should not be encoded when parsed as the suffix parameter.
   
Determine a suitable suffix

   Use the set of bindings to find a suitable suffix (or index) for a certain combination
   of language, media type and encoding given in the anchor. Returns a pointer to a
   suitable suffix string that must be freed  by the caller. If more than one suffix is
   found they are all concatenated. If no suffix is found, NULL is returned.
