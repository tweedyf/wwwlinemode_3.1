Parsing URIs

   These functions can be used to get information in a URI.
   
  PARSE A URI RELATIVE TO ANOTHER URI
  
   This returns those parts of a name which are given (and requested) substituting bits
   from the related name where necessary. The aName argument is the (possibly relative)
   URI to be parsed, the relatedName is the URI which the aName is to be parsed relative
   to. Passing an empty string means that the aName is an absolute URI. The following are
   flag bits which may be OR'ed together to form a number to give the 'wanted' argument to
   HTParse.

/*

   PUNCTUATION means any delimiter like '/', ':', '#' between the tokens above. The string
   returned by the function must be freed by the caller.

  CREATE A RELATIVE (PARTIAL) URI
  
   This function creates and returns a string which gives an expression of one address as
   related to another.  Where there is no relation, an absolute address is retured.
   
  ON ENTRY,
  
   Both names must be absolute, fully qualified names of nodes (no anchor bits)
   
  ON EXIT,
  
   The return result points to a newly allocated name which, if parsed by HTParse relative
   to relatedName, will yield aName. The caller is responsible for freeing the resulting
   name later.

Canonicalization

   Canonicalization of URIs is a difficult job, but it saves a lot of down loads and
   double entries in the cache if we do a good job...
   
  CANONICALIZE THE PATH PART OF A URI
  
   A URI is allowed to contain the seqeunce xxx/../ which may be replaced by "" , and the
   seqeunce "/./" which may be replaced by "/". Simplification helps us recognize
   duplicate URIs. Thus, the following transformations are done:
   
       /etc/junk/../fred
      becomes
      /etc/fred
      
       /etc/junk/./fred
      becomes
      /etc/junk/fred
      
   but we should NOT change
   
       http://fred.xxx.edu/../.. or
      
       ../../albert.html
      
   In the same manner, the following prefixed are preserved:
   
       ./
      
       //
      
   In order to avoid empty URIs the following URIs become:
   
       /fred/..
      
      becomes /fred/..
      
       /fred/././..
      
      becomes /fred/..
      
       /fred/.././junk/.././
      becomes /fred/..
      
   If more than one set of `://' is found (several proxies in cascade) then only the part
   after the last `://' is simplified.
   
 */
extern char *HTSimplify PARAMS((char **filename));/*

  CANONICALIZE THE DNS PART OF A URI
  
   This function expands the host name of the URI from a local name to a full domain name
   and converts the host name to lower case. The advantage by doing this is that we only
   have one entry in the host case and one entry in the document cache.

                                char *  host));/*

Prevent Security Holes

   In many telnet like protocols, it can be very dangerous to allow a full ASCII character
   set to be in a URI. Therefore we have to strip them out. HTCleanTelnetString() makes
   sure that the given string doesn't contain characters that could cause security holes,
   such as newlines in ftp, gopher, news or telnet URLs; more specifically: allows
   everything between hexadesimal ASCII 20-7E, and also A0-FE, inclusive.
   
  str                     the string that is *modified* if necessary.  The string will be
                             truncated at the first illegal character that is encountered.
                         
  returns                 YES, if the string was modified.      NO, otherwise.
