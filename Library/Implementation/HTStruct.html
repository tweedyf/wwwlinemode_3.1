A structured object is something which can reasonably be represented
in for eaxmple SGML.  I'll rephrase that.  A structured object is am
ordered tree-structured arrangement of data which is representable as
text. An example is the SGML parser which outputs to a
<CODE>Structured Object</CODE>. A Structured object can output its
contents to another <CODE>Structured Object</CODE>. It's a kind of
typed stream. The architecure is largely Dan Conolly's. Elements and
entities are passed to the sob by number, implying a knowledge of the
DTD.<P>

The <CODE>Streuctured Stream</CODE> is a subclass of a <A
HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Object</A>. As always, we don't
have classes in basic C so we have to do this by hand! <P>

<B>NOTE:</B> The <CODE>put_block</CODE> method was <CODE>write</CODE>,
but this upset systems which had macros for <CODE>write()</CODE>. See
the <A HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Definition</A> for valid
return codes.<P>

See the <A HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Definition</A> for an
explanation of these methods. Note that they all have a
<CODE>HTStructured</CODE> object a the parameter, not a generic
stream. This is to avoid <EM>incompatible pointer</EM> warnings

    void (*start_element)	PARAMS((HTStructured *	me,

					CONST BOOL *	attribute_present,
					CONST char **	attribute_value));

					int		element_number));

    void (*put_entity)		PARAMS((HTStructured *	me,
