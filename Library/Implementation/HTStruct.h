   A structured object is something which can reasonably be represented in for eaxmple
   SGML.  I'll rephrase that.  A structured object is am ordered tree-structured
   arrangement of data which is representable as text. An example is the SGML parser which
   outputs to a Structured Object. A Structured object can output its contents to another
   Structured Object. It's a kind of typed stream. The architecure is largely Dan
   Conolly's. Elements and entities are passed to the sob by number, implying a knowledge
   of the DTD.
   
   The Streuctured Stream is a subclass of a Generic Stream Object. As always, we don't
   have classes in basic C so we have to do this by hand!
   
   NOTE: The put_block method was write, but this upset systems which had macros for
   write(). See the Generic Stream Definition for valid return codes.
