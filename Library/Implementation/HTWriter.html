This version of the stream object just writes to a socket. The socket
is assumed open and closed afterward.There are two versions (identical
on ASCII machines) one of which converts to ASCII on output.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTWriter.c">HTWriter.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/">
W3C Reference Library</A>. <P>
