This module resisters all the plug &amp; play software modules which will
be used in the program on client side (The server has it's own initialization
module). <P>

The initialization consists of definiting four bindings:

<UL>
<LI>Between a source media type and a dest media type (conversion)
<LI>Between media types and external viewers/presenters
<LI>Between file extensions and media types
<LI>Between an access method and a protocol module
</UL>

To override the default behavior, you can do two things:

<UL>
<LI>Use the <CODE>HT_NO_INIT</CODE> preprocessor define
<LI>Copy it and link in your version before you link with the library.
</UL>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTInit.c">HTInit.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/">
W3C Reference Library</A>.

<H2>Media Type Conversions</H2>

The <EM>Converters</EM> are used to convert a media type to another
media type, or to present it on screen. This is a part of the stream
stack algorithm. The Presenters are also used in the stream stack, but
are initialized separately.

<PRE>
extern void HTConverterInit PARAMS((HTList * conversions));
</PRE>

<H2>Presenters</H2>

The <EM>Presenters</EM> are used to present a media type to the use by
calling an external program, for example a post script viewer. This is
a part of the stream stack algorithm. The Converters are also used in
the stream stack, but are initialized separately.

<PRE>
extern void HTPresenterInit PARAMS((HTList * conversions));
</PRE>

<H2>Converters and Presenters</H2>

This function is only defined in order to preserve backward
compatibility.

<PRE>
extern void HTFormatInit PARAMS((HTList * conversions));
</PRE>

<H2>Protocol Modules</H2>

Set up default bindings between access schemes and the set of protocol
modules in the Library.

<PRE>
#ifndef HT_NO_INIT
extern void HTAccessInit NOPARAMS;
#endif
</PRE>

<H2>File Suffix Setup</H2>

This functions defines a basic set of file suffixes and the
corresponding media types.

<PRE>
#ifndef HT_NO_INIT
extern void HTFileInit NOPARAMS;
#endif

#endif

End of HTInit Module.
